# Search Engines

Here you can find some of the most supported search engines for the Nintendo 3DS browser.

### Google

The most compatible and reliable, it still works but you can't sign in to your Google account, but it's not necessary.

[Go to the website](https://google.com)

### DuckDuckGo HTML

This one doesn't use JavaScript, so it's faster. But it has the downside of not having search results other than text.

### Yahoo

This isn't reccomended in "Old" 3DS models since it uses HTML5 but it works almost perfectly in "New" 3DS consoles.

### FrogFind

FrogFind is like DuckDuckGo but with a more "retro" style.

### Bing

Bing also work well in "New" 3DS consoles, a bit less well in "Old" 3DS consoles.
