# Modern web services

There are some web services (social ecc) that still works in the Nintendo 3DS browser. Here are a few ones.

### Facebook

Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook. Still works, gives a warning on the login page but everything works fine after logging in. Since facebook has still a lot of old clients this version of the website, which is made in a simple way for the low-end devices.

### (Old) Reddit

The old version of reddit still works perfectly in the Nintendo 3DS browser. It's a bit small but you can zoom in and the problem is solved. Sadly you can't use your account.
