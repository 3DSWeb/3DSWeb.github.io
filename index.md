# 3DSWeb Collection
Here you can find a set of websites and resources that work with the Nintendo 3DS family's browser.

Please remember that since the "Old" models (Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo 2DS, Nintendo 3DS XL) have a sligtly worser browser than the "New" models, so if you are using an "Old" model expect that some content won't load since it doesn't support video playback, HTML5 and advanced JavaScript.

### Contribute

If you want to add a website or your website, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/3dsWeb/3dsweb.github.io/issues) adding the web address. Every type of website is allowed! 

All of the sites are tested to work in the "New" model, but if you have an "Old" model and you want to report a site that's not working you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/3dsWeb/3dsweb.github.io/issues) and we will report it. Thanks for the contribution.
